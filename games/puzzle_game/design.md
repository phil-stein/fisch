? random tool, should player be given a random tool, i.e. portal-gun/grapple-gun/etc.

## mechanics
  - interactables: lever/button/etc.
  - 


# remove dead entities from world_translucent_arr / world_opaque_arr

# [X] mouse over ui doesnt disable gizmos

# ? setting pos in properties window sometimes gets reset when touching another value after setting one

# bump_alloc.h bum_walk_back() or some to free some bytes but not all ( f.e. for world_translucent_sorted )

# starting editor in WINDOW_MAX has weird graphical bugg, maybe window_width/_height set wrong

# go through all files and remove unnecesary(?) header includes for compile speedup

# actually design a fucking game to make
